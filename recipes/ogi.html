<h2>Prepared Ogi bowl</h2>
<p>Ogi (or Akamu) is a fermented cereal pudding from Nigeria, typically made from maize, sorghum, or millet.[1] Traditionally, the grains are soaked in water for up to three days, before wet-milling and sieving to remove husks. The filtered cereal is then allowed to ferment for up to three days until sour. It is then boiled into a pap, or cooked to make a creamy pudding. It may be eaten with moin moin, akara or Bread depending on individual choice.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wet Corn Starch (Akamu, Ogi or Pap)</li>
<li>Water (Hot and Cold)</li>
<li>Evaporated Milk (Peak Milk)</li>
<li>Sugar (to taste)</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>plates/bowl</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
   <li>Put some lumps of akamu/ogi/pap into a sizeable bowl. Akamu rises during preparation so you should use a bowl big enough to contain the meal in its risen state. If in doubt, use a very big bowl, with time, you will learn which quantity can comfortably fit is which bowl size.</li>
   <li>Use a tablespoon to crush the lumps of ogi into very small pieces.</li>
   <li>Add cool water in small quantities and mix till you have a medium consistency with no lumps. Your aim should be to mix the akamu as thick as possible. See the video below.</li>
   <li>Put a kettle of water to boil. Make sure the water will be enough. It is better to boil too much water than not have enough water when making akamu.</li>
   <li>Just before the water boils, stir the mix very well because some of the ogi may have settled at the bottom of the bowl. If not stirred well, this is the major cause of lumps when you start making it.</li>
   <li>Once the water boils, pour it slowly but steadily in a circular motion into the bowl of akamu and stir at the same time. Pouring the hot water slowly and stirring at the same is very important because this prevents lumps.</li>
   <li>Once you see the mixture setting, stop stirring and reduce the flow of water you are pouring till the akamu has completely set.</li>
   <li>Set the kettle aside and stir the pap very well. If it is too thick for you, you can add more hot water. But be careful else it will become watery. Remember that you will still add liquid evaporated milk.</li>
   <li>Add peak evaporated milk and some sugar to taste and stir everything to the way you like it.</li>
