 <h2>Prepared bowl of Egusi Soup </h2> 
<p>
    Egusi soup is popular in Western Africa. The soup is thickened with ground melon, gourd, or squash seeds. Pounded yam is a popular African dish similar to mashed potatoes but heavier. Pounded Yam is very smooth and tasty.

<p>
    It has vitamins B1 and B2 which are important for body growth and the production of red blood cells. Vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron and maintain healthy tissue, is also found in the seeds. It also has Niacin, which helps maintain healthy skin

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meats and/or fish</li>
<li>Egusi mash</li>
<li>oinions</li>
<li>Palm oil</li>
<li>crayfish</li>
<li>seasoning</li>
</ul> 
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
 <li>the meats and/or fish you intend to use. Preferably do this the day before so making your egusi soup is easy the next day.</li>
<li>Grind the egusi. I advise that you always buy whole egusi seeds and grind them yourself. That way you are sure of the quality of the seeds. Pre-ground egusi is not always the best.</li>
<li>Saute onions in red palm oil, cook egusi in red palm oil then add the boiled meats, crayfish and seasoning. It is really that easy.</li>
