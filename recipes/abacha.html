<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First wash, season and cook the kpomo(slice the kpomo into tiny bits).  b. Soak the dry prawns in hot water to soften them a bit and strain. c.  If you haven,t done this yet, also cut the fresh fish and fry.  Also shred the boiled dried fish / stock fish. Then set all aside for later use.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the ground akaun (potash) in about 3-4 tablespoonful of water and pass through a sieve to remove particles. Set the liquid aside for later use. e. Rinse the Ugba in lukewarm water, strain and set aside. f. Place the dry abacha in a bowl and soak in cold water for about 8 minutes until it goes from pure white color.</li>
        <li>Another method is to pour hot boiling water over the dry abacha, stir well and leave to soak for 1-2 minutes.  Then pour the abacha into a sieve and let the water strain.</li>
        <li>Slice one onion bulb into rings, and dice or pound the other onion bulb. Now for the preparation.... 1. Pour the palm oil into a clean dry pot, add the potash liquid and mix until the color begins to chage from orange to yellow and the mixture becomes a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Add  the crayfish, pepper, diced/pounded onions, the ground ehuru(calabash nutmeg), ogiri and stock bube, mix thoroughly until well combined. 3. Now, place the pot on low heat, add the strained abacha and adjust for salt if neccessary. Mix well and put off the heat as soon as the abacha is warmed up. Tip: don't leave the abacha for too long on heat, or you'll end up with ''Abacha pottage'</li>
        <li>You can choose to serve  the meal as it is, along with the accompaniments, but if you choose to go further and mix it all in one pot.     4. Then, add the ugba(ukpaka),chopped garden eggs, the cooked dried/stock fish(if using), softened large prawns, and the kpomo. Mix well until all the ingredients are well blended.</li>
